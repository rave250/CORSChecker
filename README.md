# CORSChecker
This is a basic plugin made in java to check for CORS misconfigurations, will be improved for all use cases

This plugin for the moment only takes into consideration the basic check of CORS: Origin header with null value.

For the moment the issue is being logged on the endpoint found only within the extension tab. 

As for further improvements, it will report also the issue in the target tab and also it will communicate with burp collaborator.
